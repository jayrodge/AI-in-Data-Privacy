PRIVACY POLICY

Introduction

The Queensland Hotels Association (QHA) aims to build and maintain positive relationships with its members, stakeholders, clients, and the general public by maintaining the highest standards of honesty, fairness, proper and ethical dealings, and confidentiality. A significant part of our business involves the collection, storage and transmission of information about people, businesses, and corporate entities, and the Association understands and accepts the requirement to protect the privacy and nature of the information held by it.

Purpose

This document specifies and explains the Association's privacy policy, and how it collects and manages the information given to and held by it.

Legislation
The over-arching legislation relevant to this policy is the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 and the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 (Cth). This policy embraces the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) enunciated in the Act.

Use and Disclosure
The Queensland Hotels Association will only use and/or disclose information for the purpose for which it was collected. The information collected by the Association is generally of two types:
· Personal information ­ information about individuals which is collected and stored on file generally in relation to applications for employment, applications for training, evaluative information, and information comprising resumes or CVs. It could include: names, mailing address, telephone numbers, email addresses, academic qualifications and so on. More sensitive information such as ethnic origin, religion, political orientation, criminal records or sexual orientation is not generally collected or held by the Association. Irrespective, the Association will not disclose any personal information to third parties without the specific, written consent of the owner of the information. This information is generally held on a paper or electronic file, and is securely destroyed at the end of the mandated holding period. The Association may disclose personal information where it is under a legal obligation to do so, including circumstances where it is under a lawful duty of care to disclose information. The Association will tell the individual about this disclosure, unless doing so is itself unlawful.
· Information about businesses and organisations ­ as a peak industry body, the Association collects, stores, uses, manipulates and shares information about businesses and organizations in the hotel and hospitality industries. It also collects information to support its database of hotel and corporate members, and its corporate sponsors and industry stakeholders. Although much of this information is on the public record, the information can also include: postal address, telephone contact details, key appointments, and email and website information. This information is generally used for the purposes of conducting the business of the Association, including research, data interpretation, marketing, and statistical and issues analysis. The Association does disclose basic details of its membership information to QHA sponsor organizations, and to QHA Corporate Members, for marketing purposes.

Collection
The Association collects information provided by individuals and organizations from correspondence, application forms, and data collection forms such as questionnaires which are raised from time to time.

Privacy Statements

Such statements will be along the lines : Privacy Statement: The Queensland Hotels Association collects personal or corporate information in

How the QHA collects and holds personal information
Information is generally collected from members when they complete and sign an application to join the QHA. This application forms part of the relevant QHA membership data. Additional information may also be collected from other QHA documentation, for example personal contact details may be required if a member applies for industry training with the QHA. Employers may also provide salary and other employment related information in seeking specialist industrial relations advice.
All information is stored in secure physical storage facilities and/or in electronic form. Electronic data is only accessible by authorised persons for appropriate purposes and is password protected.
The purposes for which the QHA collects, holds, uses and discloses Personal Information The QHA will only collect, hold, use and disclose the information it reasonably requires for its usual business functions and activities. Further details of these are set out later in this Policy.

APP 2 ­ Anonymity and Pseudonymity
When dealing with the QHA in relation to a particular matter, individuals have the option of not identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym, where it is practical and lawful to do so.

APP 3 ­ Collection of Personal Information

Personal information other than sensitive information
The QHA will not collect personal information (other than sensitive information) unless the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of the QHA's functions or activities.
Sensitive Information
The QHA will not collect sensitive information about an individual unless the individual consents to the collection of the information and the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of the QHA's functions or activities. Exceptions may apply where the collection of the information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order.
Functions and activities of the QHA

· Setting up one or more membership accounts
· Collecting Tax File Numbers as required by superannuation legislation
· Receiving and posting information on behalf of QHA members, either by the member themselves, their employer or their spouse
· Collecting and assessing health/medical information for the purpose of providing employment or industrial relations advice to members

· Collecting personal contact information related to applications for industry training

APP 4 - Dealing with Unsolicited Personal Information

If the QHA refuses to correct the personal information as requested by the individual and the individual requests the QHA associates with the information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, the QHA will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to associate the statement in such a way that will make the statement apparent to users of the information.
The QHA will deal with a request to correct personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made and will not charge the individual for the making of the request, for correcting the personal information or for associating the statement with the personal information (as the case may be).
Review of the Policy

The Association will abide by the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988, the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 (Cth), and the Australian Privacy Principles, and will review this policy from time to time to ensure its continued relevance and accuracy.
