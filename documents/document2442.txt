13 PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS
13.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to provide a set of business rules that align with OTN's responsibilities with respect to the protection of Personal Information (PI) as well as Section 6 of Ontario Regulation 329/04 of the `Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 ("PHIPA"). PHIPA requires that OTN, in its capacity as a "health information network provider" ("HINP"), performs an assessment of the services it provides with respect to threats, vulnerabilities and risks to the security and integrity of PHI and reports on how the services may affect the privacy of the individuals who are the subject of the information managed by that service.
According to the Regulation, OTN acts as a HINP when it provides services to two or more health information custodians ("HICs") where the services are provided primarily to custodians to enable the custodians to use electronic means to disclose personal health information to one another, whether or not the person is an agent of any of the custodians. [O. Reg. 329/04, s. 6 (2)]
The Regulation also requires that OTN report a summary of its findings to all applicable HICs.
13.2 SCOPE
All OTN employees, students and consultants must comply with the applicable sections of this policy as a condition of continued employment or engagement.
13.3 POLICY
A privacy impact assessment is a detailed assessment undertaken to identify the actual or potential effects that a proposed project will have on the privacy of those whose personal information is included in the proposed project. A privacy impact assessment also identifies ways in which privacy risks may be mitigated.
OTN must conduct formal privacy impact assessments when acting in its capacity as a HINP to health information custodians, as required by the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004. OTN must complete a privacy impact assessment in relation to all new OTN service offerings to health information custodians, or other entities, where those service offerings involve personal health information. Further, OTN must comply with all privacy impact assessment requirements identified in its project funding agreements with Canada Health Infoway.
In all instances, OTN must determine the scope and necessity of conducting privacy impact assessments by first conducting a "privacy threshold assessment" whenever OTN is contemplating a new or modified activity which involves the handling of personal information or personal health information by OTN or through OTN service offerings. A privacy threshold assessment is a preliminary, standardized analysis used to determine whether or not an initiative will require a full privacy impact assessment, an update (or `delta') to an existing privacy impact assessment, or another level of privacy assurance services, such as an abridged privacy review or consulting services.

38

Public

PRIVACY POLICY FRAMEWORK - DECEMBER 2014

The scope of the Monitoring Review will be based on the following elements:  Report to others: Establish a clear purpose and demand for undertaking monitoring, review and
evaluation activities. Information produced from this process must be targeted for specific audiences and be incorporated into the governance of OTN in order to enhance transparency and accountability. Activities that occur isolated from decision-making or commence after implementation is complete are of limited value to initiative participants. Monitoring reviews are optimally conducted during the implementation of a program and based on criteria set out in the planning stages of a program.  Involve stakeholders: Engages all relevant stakeholders for monitoring, review and evaluation activities to be successful. Clearly communicating the benefits of activities and providing the necessary support creates opportunity for willing participation and ownership. An open process that allows stakeholders access to information increases credibility.  Monitor progress: Delivers timely and relevant information that allows you to track progress towards outcomes and make adjustments to implementation arrangements as necessary. Tracks progress in a deliberate and systematic manner at regular intervals during implementation. Implementation planning must define the data to be collected and the method used for monitoring. Obtaining advice from experts in data collection during the planning process will contribute to a robust and credible methodology. Monitoring will inform other components of implementation such as risk management.  Review regularly: Incorporates reviews as part of privacy program planning process to assess progress of implementation at critical milestones or in response to specific issues. Reviews are a `snapshot' in the life of an initiative and tend to focus on operational issues, effectiveness of

50

Public

PRIVACY POLICY FRAMEWORK - DECEMBER 2014
governance and project management structures, and may also include policy outcomes. Findings and recommendations from reviews should be used to improve implementation.  Evaluate the outcomes: Identify the extent to which intended and unintended policy outcomes are achieved and how they have affected stakeholders. Planning for evaluation should identify and map baseline information as well as ensure that ongoing access to consistent data sources will be available through monitoring over the life of the initiative. Data can be quantitative (hard or numerical data) or qualitative (soft or categorical). The evaluation will focus on asking good questions to assess the data collected. Credibility of an evaluation is enhanced through sound evidence, professional and ethical standards, and the degree of independence of the evaluator. Effective evaluation is the result of a planning process over the life of the initiative.
16.2.5 Persons Responsible for the Privacy Audits and monitoring reviews
The Director, Privacy/CPO (or designate) will assume primary responsibility for the privacy audit and monitoring reviews

17 PRIVACY BREACH MANAGEMENT
17.1 PURPOSE
This privacy incident and breach management policy provides guidance to OTN employees, students, consultants and other individuals to take appropriate steps in the event of a privacy incident or breach. This includes particular roles and responsibilities, notification protocols to affected individuals, health information custodians and the Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner, as appropriate.
In the event of a privacy incident or breach involving PHI and PI occurring in a shared information service or OTN's Telemedicine environment, this policy and procedures sets out the points of responsibility within OTN to respond quickly and effectively by following best practices to monitor, report, contain, notify, investigate, and remediate an incident.
17.2 SCOPE
Although not all incidents result in a privacy breach, all investigations including those related to near misses and non-breach incidents will follow the same process. All employees, students, consultants and other individuals providing services to OTN must comply with the applicable sections of this policy as a condition of continued employment or engagement.
17.3 POLICY
17.3.1 Duty to Report Privacy Incident
Any employee, student, consultant or other individual providing services to OTN who becomes aware of a privacy-related incident has the duty to report that incident as soon as practically possible to the OTN's Privacy Team. The privacy team has the duty to lead the investigation process and, where appropriate, work with other organizations as part of the investigation, follow-up, mediation and response. At the discretion of OTN's Chief Privacy Officer and CEO this may include reporting the incident to affected individuals and the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.
Upon discovery of an actual or potential privacy incident, OTN shall act immediately to contain the incident to prevent further damage (see section 17.6.3 on containment).
Depending on the scope and severity of the privacy breach, the OTN Director, Privacy/CPO or his or her delegate may escalate the incident details to the OTN senior leadership team in accordance with its escalation process.
All privacy breach documentation is considered a "living" document until the investigation of the incident or breach is satisfactorily concluded and signed off by the OTN Director, Privacy/CPO.
A privacy incident occurs when anyone who has cause to work for or with OTN in its Telemedicine environment:  Has contravened or is about to contravene a provision of PHIPA or its Regulations;

54

o Level of encryption/accessibility o Potential for fraudulent use  Causes and Extent of Incident/Breach o Determine cause of incident/breach. o Determine risk of further exposure of PHI/PI. o Determine extent of the unauthorized access to or collection, use or disclosure of personal
information, including the number and nature of likely recipients and the risk of further access, use or disclosure. o Determine if information lost or stolen and if stolen, was information target of theft or not. o Determine status of information recovery. o Describe steps taken to mitigate harm. o Determine if systemic or isolated problem. o Determine number of individuals affected by incident/breach. o Determine who is affected: staff, contractors, public, HICs, other organizations.  Foreseeable Harm  In assessing the possibility of foreseeable harm from the breach, the privacy team considers the reasonable expectations of the individuals.  Determine who the recipient of the information is. Is there any relationship between the unauthorized recipients and the data subject? For example, was the disclosure to an unknown party or to a party suspected of being involved in criminal activity where there is a potential risk of misuse? Or was the recipient a trusted, known entity or person that would reasonably be expected to return the information without disclosing or using it?  What harm to the individuals could result from the breach? Examples include: o security risk (e.g., physical safety) o identity theft o financial loss o loss of business or employment opportunities o humiliation, damage to reputation or relationships  What harm to the organization could result from the breach? Examples include: o loss of trust in OTN o loss of assets o financial exposure o legal proceedings (i.e., class action suits)  What harm could come to the public as a result of notification of the breach?

Public

PRIVACY POLICY FRAMEWORK - DECEMBER 2014
A log of all incidents or breaches, real or suspected, is maintained by the privacy team. High level investigation indicators are documented, tracked and reported in the privacy team's scorecard and shared with the Privacy and Security Lateral Team, the Senior Leadership Team and the Board.
17.6.5 Notifying Individuals of Incidents
Where there is a privacy breach in accordance with PHIPA and/or other applicable legislation, OTN will notify all applicable health information custodians (HICs) and other appropriate stakeholders at the first reasonable opportunity.
It is not OTN's role to notify the individual(s) to whom the breached PHI or PI belongs, but it is OTN's responsibility to notify the HIC or other stakeholder of the breach. The HIC or other stakeholder will then notify, as required, the individual(s) whose PHI or PI was disclosed.
The purpose of providing notice of a privacy breach to the subject individual(s) is to provide information about the incident, the nature of potential or actual risks or harm, what mitigating actions are being taken and appropriate future action for individuals to take to protect their information.
Healthcare organizations are required to notify individuals (patients/clients) whose PHI was stolen, lost, or accessed by unauthorized persons, as well as collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose not permitted by PHIPA.
Notification to affected individuals should be made by the impacted organization where only one HIC is involved or through mutual consensus of the impacted organizations where multiple organizations are involved. Where possible, the HIC with the closest relationship to the client should provide the notice if it is impacted by the incident.
Notification must include:  The date of the incident  A general description of what happened  A description of the PHI or PI inappropriately accessed, collected, used or disclosed  The steps taken to control or reduce the harm and steps planned to prevent further incidents  The steps affected individuals can take to protect themselves, if applicable (e.g., how to contact the
MOHLTC for OHIP monitoring)  The contact information of an individual who can provide further information or assistance and  How to make a complaint to the IPC
17.6.6 Remediation
The privacy team will establish a remediation plan to address the potential cause(s) of the incident and minimize the likelihood of identical or similar incidents from reoccurring. A remediation plan should include the following, as appropriate to the specific incident:  A detailed description of the remediation activity (e.g., a review of relevant information management
systems, any amendments or reinforcements to existing policies and/or practices, development and implementation of new security or privacy measures, testing and evaluating remedial plans and training of staff)  Designation of individual(s) responsible for implementing remediation  Description of any need for amendment or reinforcement of existing policies, procedures, or practices for managing and safeguarding PHI or PI

59

Public

PRIVACY POLICY FRAMEWORK - DECEMBER 2014

 Recommendations related to the development or implementation of new security or privacy measures, if required
 A review of employee training to reduce potential or future breaches, and recommendations to strengthen it as required
 Recommendations for remedial action to the appropriate internal and external stakeholders  Escalation of more wide scale or complex remedial actions to OTN's Enterprise Risk Management
committee
17.6.7 Prevention of Future Breaches
Once the immediate steps are taken to mitigate the risks associated with the breach, OTN will investigate the cause of the breach and consider whether to develop a prevention plan. The level of effort should reflect the significance of the breach and whether it was a systemic breach or an isolated instance. This plan may include the following:  a security audit of both physical and technical security;  a review of policies and procedures and any changes to reflect the lessons learned from the
investigation and regularly after that (e.g., security policies, record retention and collection policies, etc.);  a review of employee training practices; and  a review of service delivery partners (e.g., HICs, contractors, service providers).
The resulting plan may include a requirement for an audit at the end of the process to ensure that the prevention plan has been fully implemented.

externally at this preliminary stage?
 Does the breach appear to involve theft or other criminal activity? If yes, have the police been
