Data Quality

The University will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up to date.

Data Breaches

As soon as possible after the breach has occurred, all suspected eligible data breaches must be referred to the University's Privacy Officer for actioning and reporting as they deem appropriate.

Information Security

The University will protect all personal information it holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by:

· Implementing industry standards for the security and protection of personal information; and · Storing information in either electronic and/or hard copy forms with access restricted to authorised
personnel only.

Security, integrity and accuracy of information is governed by the University's Information and Communication Technologies Security Policy and Records Management Policy and related procedures.

Privacy and Confidentiality Obligations

Staff members, students, researchers, contractors and any other third party who collect use or disclose personal information on behalf of the University have a responsibility to act consistent with the Information Privacy Principles and Australian Privacy Principles and to take appropriate measures to avoid a breach of confidence.

At any time during and after employment with the University, staff members must not use, divulge, copy or communicate any confidential information to any person without the University's consent, regardless of whether the other person is an employee of the University or not, except as required in the ordinary performance of the staff member's duties.
Unauthorised access to personal information must be reported to the University's Privacy Officer and, where relevant, to the responsible owner of the information system concerned. Failure to comply with this Policy may necessitate disciplinary action.
University matters relating to individuals or non-public information must not be discussed, except where directly related to the staff member's role, as this may constitute a breach of confidence and therefore misconduct.
Information and Communication Technologies Facilities
Users of the University's Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) facilities are reminded that anything that is written or recorded is potentially subject to subpoena or Freedom of Information requests or other authorised access. Inappropriate use of the University's Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) facilities may be subject to disciplinary action.
Access and Correction
On the request of an individual, the University will take reasonable steps to inform the individual of the kind of personal information it holds, why it holds the information and how it collects, holds, uses and discloses the information.
On the request of an individual, the University will provide access to their personal information, except to the extent that:
· Providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of the individual or another individual; or
· Providing access would prejudice measures for the protection of the health or safety of the public; or
· Providing access would unreasonably interfere with the privacy of another individual; or · The request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or · The information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between the University and the
individual and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery or subpoena in those proceedings; or · Providing access would reveal the intentions of the University in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way that would prejudice the negotiations; or · Providing access would be unlawful; or · Denying access is required or authorised by law; or · Providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or · Providing access would be likely to prejudice one or more of the following by or on behalf of a law enforcement agency:
o Preventing, detecting, investigating, prosecuting or punishing an offence or a breach of a prescribed law;
o Enforcing a law relating to the confiscation of proceeds of crime; o Protecting public revenue; o Preventing, detecting, investigating or remedying seriously improper conduct or

o Preparing for or conducting proceedings in a court or tribunal or implementing the orders of a court or tribunal; or
· Providing access would prejudice: o The security or defence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory of the Commonwealth; or o The maintenance of law and order in the Territory.
However, where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within the University in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, the University may give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than access to the decision.
If the University holds personal information about an individual and the individual establishes that the information is not accurate, complete or up to date, the University will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.
If an individual and the University disagree about whether personal information about the individual held by the University is accurate, complete or up to date; and
· The individual requests the University to associate with the information a statement to the effect that, in the individual's opinion, the information is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date;
· The University will take reasonable steps to comply with that request.
The University will provide reasons for refusing to provide access to or correct personal information.
If an individual requests the University for access to, or to correct personal information held by the University, the University will, within a reasonable time:
· Provide access or reasons for refusing access; or · Make the correction or provide reasons for refusing to make it; or · Provide reasons for the delay in responding to the request;
If the University charges a fee for providing access to personal information, the fee will not to be excessive. Access and amendment requests should be directed to the University's Privacy Officer.
Notification of correction to third parties
If the University corrects personal information that the University previously disclosed to another entity, and the individual requests the University to notify the other entity of the correction, the University will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to give that notification unless it is impracticable or unlawful to do so.
Sensitive Information
The University will not collect sensitive information about an individual unless:
· The individual consents to the collection; or · The University is authorised or required by law to collect the information; or · The individual is:
o Physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the collection; or o Physically unable to communicate his or her consent to the collection; and o Collecting the information is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat
to the life or health of the individual or another individual; or

· Collecting the information is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal or equitable claim.
However, the University may collect sensitive information about an individual if:
· The collection: o Is necessary for research, or the compilation or analysis of statistics, relevant to government funded targeted welfare or educational services; or o Is of information relating to an individual's racial or ethnic origin and is for the purpose of providing government funded targeted welfare or educational services; and
· There is no other reasonably practicable alternative to collecting the information for that purpose; and
· It is impracticable for the organisation to seek the individual's consent to the collection.
Complaints
Questions in relation to concerns about privacy, the University's management of personal information, or to make a complaint, should be directed to the University's Privacy Officer or the Northern Territory Information Commissioner.
Non-Compliance
Members of the University community must be aware of and note that the University regards any activity, which constitutes unacceptable access, use or disclosure as potentially serious matters that the University may determine as misconduct or serious misconduct.
