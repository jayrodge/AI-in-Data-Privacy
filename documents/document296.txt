Which information we may collect on our Users? We may collect two types of data and information from our Users: a. The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information ("Non-personal

Users of the Site automatically provide their IP address mainly for enhancing the User's experience and for geolocation and security purposes as further detailed below.

Users provide within the contact form ("Contact Form") within our Site which includes their full name, phone number, e-mail address, company name and which of our departments such User is interested in.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained, inter alia, through your active acceptance to the Terms and the Privacy Policy.

Site we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed below. b.

We store the Personal Information either independently or through the help of our authorized third-party service providers as detailed below.
