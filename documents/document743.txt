Privacy Policies
This document describes Wounded Warrior Project's ("WWP") use of information regarding the warriors and families we serve, financial supporters of our mission, supporters under the age of 18, and general visitors to our website.
General User Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to general users of the WWP website and describes how WWP protects information you provide when you use this website.
Although elements of this policy may apply to the veterans we serve, their caregivers, and our donors who visit our website, we do collect additional data from these groups of people. Warriors and their caregivers who register for WWP's programs and services can find additional information about how WWP uses their information on our Alumni and Caregiver Privacy Policy. Donors and supporters of WWP can find additional information about how WWP uses their information on our Donor Privacy Policy. Both policies may be found below.
WWP is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. It is our goal that you fully understand how we collect information, how we use that information, and the steps we've taken to protect that information. We will update this policy from time to time, so make sure to check this page periodically. If you have any questions about this policy, please email us at wwplegal@woundedwarriorproject.org.
What type of information does WWP collect?
There are two basic types of information that WWP might collect: personal and non-personal information.
As you browse the WWP website, you may opt to provide WWP with personal information. Personal information is information that contains identifiers such as your name, address, phone number, or email address.
WWP may also collect non-personal information from you such as an internet protocol address (typically referred to as an "IP address" and defined below) and browsing variables (like your web browser, referral links, or how much time you spent at our website). Although this information may on rare occasion be used to identify you, WWP typically uses this information to improve your experience and the experience of other visitors to our website. WWP may use cookies to collect this type of information.
What's a cookie? A cookie is a small data text file that individual websites store on your computer's hard drive ­ if your web browser permits. The website can later retrieve that cookie to let us know you've been to our site before. Cookies typically make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly, and help us to maintain a secure site. Many websites use cookies. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do that.
What's an IP address? An IP address is a unique number, assigned to each and every computer and other device on the Internet. Your computer, your phone, your e-reader, and other electronic devices, are all assigned IP addresses.
When does WWP collect this information?
We collect non-personal information from you as you use any of the pages on our website. We collect personal information from you only when you specifically provide it to us ­ for example, if you fill out a form or send us an email.

Effective as of May 4, 2018
How does WWP use the information we collect?
WWP uses information from different site visitors in different ways. We generally use information provided to us through the donation process in accordance with the Donor Privacy Policy; we generally use information provided to us by the warriors and caregivers we serve in accordance with the Alumni and Caregiver Privacy Policy. Both policies may be found below.
On rare occasion, we use personal information provided by general users of our website who are not warriors or caregivers and are not engaging in the donation process. We might, for example, ask for your information if you contact a local WWP representative or if you upload a personal video message to our warriors.
We may also use your personal and non-personal information in the following ways:
- Entering your information into our databases for internal record keeping, reporting, and data analysis;
- Communicating with you to obtain your input, provide information about our programs and events, or request contributions (provided you have opted to receive such communications);
- Improving our programs and services; - Customizing our website according to your interests; - Sharing information with third parties who help us manage our website and databases, and who
assist us with our marketing efforts; and - Sharing information with third parties as required by law, or a part of a legal process;
We have contracted with Yahoo, and other online marketing companies, to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement "click-throughs," and other activities on our website. No personally identifiable data is transferred to Yahoo by us. Where authorized by us, Yahoo may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.
If you choose, you may opt out from Yahoo's collection of such information outside of the Yahoo distribution network by clicking on the following link: http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html.
You may learn more about your control over this information by clicking here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
We also reserve the right to use non-personal information, such as an IP address, to identify a user when we believe it is necessary to protect the compelling interests of our websites, the warriors we serve, their caregivers, our donors, our employees, or others, or to comply with laws, court orders, or law enforcement requests.
Does WWP share my information?
WWP may share your personal and non-personal information as discussed herein. We do not, however, sell or rent the personal information of our general website users for profit.
Does WWP track my online activity while I'm not on the WWP site?
Cookies and other technology may be used to track non-personal information about your web-browsing habits. For example, if a significant portion of our visitors all browse to the same website immediately after visiting us, we may use this information to improve your experience at our site.

Effective as of May 4, 2018
WWP respects web browser "do not track" signals and other mechanisms that provide you the ability to opt out of having your personal information or online activities collected. But remember, unless you have selected the "do not track" function in your web browser, third parties (not just WWP) may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites.
How does WWP secure my personal information?
WWP is committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. Your trust in us is important, so we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Records containing personal information are stored at secure facilities; our websites use SSL (a tool used to verify the legitimacy of a website); and our employees are provided training on how to treat your data securely.
Will you contact me if I give WWP my information?
If you provide us with your contact information, we may provide you with information about how you can help this generation of injured veterans. However, if you would not like to receive these messages, you can opt out of having your personal information used for certain purposes when we ask for your contact information.
If you are already receiving those messages and would like to stop receiving them, you may opt out by following the instructions included in the message or by calling our Donor Care team at 877.TEAM.WWP (832.6997).

Links to other websites and third party services
Sometimes we'll provide you with a link to another website or service. We typically do this in order to provide you additional information about one of our sponsors to others who support the mission of WWP.
WWP may also include other electronic services on our website. For example, this could include a tool that allows you to contact your local politicians, or to create a custom message to send to veterans. These services are typically provided by third parties, and may require you to agree to that service provider's own privacy statement and terms of use. This policy does not cover these third party services or how those third parties may use the information you provide them. We encourage you to review those privacy policies and terms of use.
