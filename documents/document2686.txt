Use of Website Tracking:
Use of Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses: An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as Web servers that serve Web pages. This allows us to identify and gather general information about your use of the site, such as the Web pages viewed on car2go to provide you service.
car2go collects IP addresses for the purposes of: helping us diagnose problems with our main computers, for system administration, to report aggregated personal information to our business partners and to audit the use of our website. When users request web pages from our website, our web servers log the user's IP address.

For example, we collect and/or track the home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of web browser used by you to access our website. Such collection and tracking personal information is gathered by us as you navigate through our website, and will be used by us for our business purposes only.
