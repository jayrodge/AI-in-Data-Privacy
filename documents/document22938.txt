No Show/Same Day Cancellation Policy
This policy has been established to help us serve you better.
Your appointment is important to us and to your health. If you miss an appointment, you may delay the treatment you need. You may also have to wait longer than you would like for a new appointment date. We do not want to keep you waiting, but our healthcare providers are heavily booked and may not be able to reschedule you immediately.
Due to the number of patients waiting for appointments at our office, it is very important that you keep each appointment and arrive promptly at the time the appointment is scheduled. For our part, we will do our best to see you at the scheduled time and provide you with professional, quality care.
We understand that situations arise in which you must cancel your appointment. In consideration of others, it is requested that you call our office 24 hours in advance to cancel/reschedule your appointment. Situations such as medical emergencies occasionally arise, when an appointment cannot be kept and adequate notice given; these will be considered on a case by case basis.
If you fail to keep an appointment without notifying the clinic in advance on three (3) occasions, consecutive or otherwise, we will not be able to schedule further appointments for you. This may also result in dismissal from the practice. Please note: Same-day cancellations are also considered no-shows.
We greatly appreciate your understanding and cooperation with this policy.

My signature below indicates that I have read the above policy and that I understand it.

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT ­ I understand that if my insurance company requires a referral, I am responsible for obtaining it. Without said referral, I am financially responsible for all charges incurred. For and in consideration of services rendered or to be rendered to the undersigned as a patient of Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod, the undersigned agrees to pay Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod, in full for all charges incurred. Should the account for charges be referred to a collection agency or to an attorney for collection, I shall pay reasonable attorney or collection fees and court costs as collection expenses.
ASSIGNMENT OF INSURANCE BENEFITS AND RELEASE OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ­ I authorize direct payment to Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod for these service rates and not to exceed Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod regular charges. It is agreed that the payment of benefits to Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod shall not discharge my responsibility to pay for charges not covered by my insurance plan. To the extent necessary to determine liability for payment and to obtain reimbursement, I authorize Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod to disclose portions of the patients' record, including medical records, to any person or corporation or governmental agency which is or may be liable for all or any portion of charges from Medical Affiliates of Cape Cod. If payment is to be made under the Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, I certify that the information given by me in applying for payment is correct and authorize any owner of medical or other information about me to release to the Social Security Administration or its intermediates or carriers any information needed of this or any related Medicare Claim.
WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION OR MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT ­ If my medical problem is work or accident related then I am responsible for obtaining the necessary billing information from my employer or claims adjuster and must specify upon check in at EACH VISIT, how that visit is to be billed. To change a claim to workmen's compensation or MVA, involves extensive paper work and a reduction of physician reimbursement. Therefore, I am responsible for an additional fee of $15.00 incurred for the increased paperwork and reduction of reimbursement if I later change my claims billing information to someone other than my usual medical health care coverage.
CONSENT TO TREAT & ePRESCRIBING ­ I, the undersigned, hereby give consent for the administration and performance of any procedure or treatment that may be deemed medically necessary or advisable based on the judgment of the attending physician or their assigned designees. I fully understand that this is given in advance of any specific diagnosis or treatment. I intend this consent to be continuing in nature even after a specific diagnosis has been made and treatment recommended. I understand that my providers may request and use my prescription medication history from other healthcare providers and/or third party pharmacy benefit managers/payers. The consent will remain in full force until revoked in writing.
A photo copy of this consent shall be considered as valid as the original.
Signed:_________________________________________________ Date:__________________________
