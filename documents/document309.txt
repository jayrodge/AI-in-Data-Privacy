Department of Finance Department of Finance Privacy Policy
1. Introduction
1.1 About this Privacy Policy
The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) requires entities bound by the Australian Privacy Principles to have a Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy outlines the personal information handling practices of the Department of Finance (Finance). This policy is written in simple language. The specific legal obligations of Finance when collecting and handling your personal information are outlined in the Privacy Act and in particular in the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) found in that Act. We will update this Privacy Policy when our information handling practices change. Updates will be publicised on our website.
1.2 Privacy Act
In general terms, the Privacy Act regulates how personal information about an individual is collected and handled. `Personal information' is information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: · whether the information or opinion is true or not, or · whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.
Personal information includes information such as: · your name or address · bank account details and credit card information · photos · internet clickstream · cookies data, or · information about your opinions.
The thirteen APPs in Schedule 1 of the Privacy Act regulate how agencies (including Finance) can: · collect · use · disclose · store, or · access
your personal information.
1.3 Who should read this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is particularly relevant to you if you are: · an individual whose personal information may be given to or held by Finance

· a contractor, consultant, supplier or vendor of goods or services to Finance · a person seeking employment, or employed with Finance · a person seeking employment, or employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff)
Act 1984 · a person seeking employment, or employed with a client agency of the Service Delivery
Office, or · a person seeking employment, or employed with the Independent Parliamentary
Expenses Authority (IPEA).
1.4 Finance and anonymity
Where possible, we will allow you to interact with us anonymously or using a pseudonym. However, for most of our functions and activities we usually need your name and contact information and enough information about the particular matter to enable us to fairly and efficiently handle your matter.

2. Personal Information Holding Practices
2.1 Collection of personal information
Personal information about you may be collected by Finance from you, from your agent or from a third party. Finance uses forms, online portals, electronic and paper correspondence as well as telephone and fax to collect this information.
Under the Privacy Act, we are required to take contractual measures to ensure that contracted service providers (including subcontractors) comply with the same privacy requirements applicable to us.
Broadly grouped, the personal information we collect and hold may include:
· documents or information relating to employment with Finance, IPEA, under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984, or with a client agency of the Service Delivery Office (e.g. personnel, email and telephone records, and information on work related travel or other expenses)
· documents relating to the appointments of persons to Commonwealth Boards · distribution and mailing lists · contact lists · internet clickstream and cookies data · comments on Finance social networking services · information relating to persons who have applied for act of grace payments, waiver of
debt, compensation and other claims · information relating to work health and safety assessments, incidents and investigations · financial and other information about tenderers, contractors and customers; · information that may be collected via Finance's Whole of Government programs (for
example curriculum vitae or email addresses) · information relating to beneficiaries of pension schemes and superannuation
administered by Finance (e.g. Judges, former Judges and former Governors-General), or · information relating to current and former members of Parliament and their work
expenses.
The APPs provide that Finance may only collect information for a lawful purpose that is directly related to a function or activity of Finance and when the collection is necessary for, or directly related to, that purpose. For example, Finance collects personal information to enable us to:
· administer relevant superannuation benefits · manage employees · manage the personnel records of employees of client agencies of the Service Delivery
Office · process work related expenses for employees of IPEA (for example corporate travel and
other related expenses) · manage appointments to Commonwealth Boards · process applications for act of grace payments, waiver of debt, compensation and other
claims

· process work expenses and manage the conditions of employment of persons employed by Finance, or under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984
· process work expenses for current and former members of Parliament, or · contact you.
2.2 Types of personal information Finance holds
Personal information we collect and hold may include: · name, address and contact details (eg phone, email and fax) · date of birth · gender · curriculum vitae · qualifications and referee reports · signature · driver's licence and passport information · bank account details and other financial information, or · next of kin.
2.3 Sensitive information
We may also collect or hold a range of sensitive information about you, including your: · racial or ethnic origin · political opinions · criminal record · financial situation (this may be relevant if you have made an application for an act of
grace payment, waiver of debt, compensation or other claim) · medical history, or · information relevant to a work health and safety assessment, incident or investigation.
If you or another person provides Finance with sensitive information, Finance will only retain the information if: · you have consented to the collection of the information and it is reasonably necessary
for, or directly related to, one of Finance's functions or activities · collection of the information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a
court/tribunal order, or · collection of the information is authorised for other purposes permitted under the Privacy
Act ­ this includes where Finance suspects that unlawful activity, or serious misconduct, relating to Finance's functions and activities has been, is being or may be engaged in.
If the sensitive information does not fall within one of these categories, Finance will not keep a record of the information and instead we will arrange for its return or secure destruction if it is lawful and reasonable to do so.

related to the primary purpose of collection or, in the case of sensitive information, directly related to the primary purpose; · the secondary use or disclosure of the personal information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order · a permitted general situation exists in relation to the secondary use or disclosure of the personal information Finance · Finance reasonably believes that the secondary use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body, or

individual's own initiative and not in response to an advertised vacancy · a promotional flyer or email containing personal information, sent to us by an individual

If we receive unsolicited personal information and we decide that we are not permitted to collect it in accordance with the APPs, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information as soon as practicable, unless it is contained in a `Commonwealth record' or it is unlawful or unreasonable to do so.
2.7 Access to and correction of personal information
Finance takes steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate, up to date and complete. These steps include maintaining and updating personal information when we are advised by individuals that their personal information has changed, and at other times as necessary. Under the Privacy Act you have the right to ask for access to personal information that we hold about, and ask that we correct that personal information. You can ask for access or correction by contacting us and we must respond within 30 days. If you ask, we must give you access to your personal information, and take responsible steps to correct it if we consider it is incorrect, unless there is a law that allows or requires us not to.
2.8 Storage and security
