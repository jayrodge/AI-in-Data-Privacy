Our Privacy Notice for UK business customers
Effective from 25 May 2018

Before we begin
This notice (Privacy Notice) applies to information held about you and individuals connected to your business by members of the HSBC Group as data controllers, as described below. It explains what information we collect about you and individuals who are connected to your business, how we'll use that information, who we'll share it with, the circumstances when we'll share it, and what steps we'll take to make sure it stays private and secure. It continues to apply even if your agreement for banking, insurance or other products and services with us ends. It should also be read alongside your banking or insurance terms and conditions (or other applicable product or service terms and conditions including insurance policy documents), as these include sections relating to the use and disclosure of information.
This Privacy Notice covers any commercial banking products or services you have with us, including savings, loans, credit cards, commercial mortgages, investments, insurance, trade finance, invoice financing, asset financing and payment services. Sometimes we may need to provide you with separate or further information about specific products and services. This will also apply if you also have a relationship with other parts of the HSBC Group (e.g. HSBC personal banking, first direct, M&S Bank or HSBC in any other countries), they'll provide you with information separately where required.
Some of the links on our websites lead to other HSBC or non-HSBC websites with their own privacy notices, which may be different to this notice. You'll need to make sure you're happy with their privacy notices when using those other sites.
Wherever we've said `you' or `your', this means you, any authorised person on your account, anyone who does your banking or deals with us for you (e.g. trustees or executors, attorneys under a Power of Attorney) and other related people (including authorised signatories, partners, members and trustees). If you are an insurance customer, it also means you, named insured or beneficiaries under your policy, dependants, claimants and other third parties involved in an insurance policy or claim (such as witnesses).
Parts of this notice relate only to individuals, and we have highlighted this where relevant. This includes individuals whose business does not have a separate legal identity (e.g. sole traders and partners in a general partnership, but excluding limited companies and other forms of corporate entity), and individuals connected to your business. An individual connected to your business could be any guarantor, a director, officer or employee of a company, partners or members of a partnership, any substantial owner, controlling person, or beneficial owner, trustee, settlor or protector of a trust, account holder of a designated account, recipient of a designated payment, your attorney or representative (e.g. authorised signatories), agent or nominee, or any other persons or entities with whom you have a relationship that's relevant to your relationship with us.
You must ensure that any relevant individuals are made aware of this notice and the individual rights and information it sets out, prior to providing their information to us or our obtaining their information from another source. If you, or anyone else on your behalf, has provided or provides information on an individual connected to your business to us (or a member of the HSBC Group), you or they must first ensure that you or they have the authority to do so.
When we say `we', we mean HSBC Group companies which act as a data controller in respect of your personal data. Unless otherwise stated below, the data controller for the purposes of this notice will be HSBC Bank plc until 30 June 2018 and, from 1 July 2018, HSBC UK Bank plc. This is because we're proposing to transfer your accounts, products and services to a new part of our bank, HSBC UK, from 1 July 2018. You shouldn't notice any change to your accounts, product, services or relationship with us. However, if we've had to make changes to your accounts, we'll have written to you separately detailing how you're affected.
The following HSBC Group companies will act as a data controller where you hold a product or service with them: HSBC Invoice Finance (UK) Ltd., HSBC Equipment Finance (UK) Ltd., HSBC Life (UK) Ltd. and, following 1 July 2018, HSBC Bank plc.
The address for the HSBC Group companies set out in this notice is 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ. If you'd like to get in touch with us, you can also find contact details below.

How long we'll keep information
We'll keep information in line with our data retention policy. For example, we'll normally keep your core banking data for a period of seven years from the end of our relationship with you. This enables us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements or to use your information where we need to for our legitimate purposes such as managing your account and dealing with any disputes or concerns that may arise.
We may need to retain information for a longer period where we need the information to comply with regulatory or legal requirements or where we may need it for our legitimate purposes (e.g. to help us respond to queries or complaints, fighting fraud and financial crime, responding to requests from regulators, etc.).
If we don't need to retain information for this period of time, we may destroy, delete or anonymise it more promptly.
Where you receive products and services from third parties (e.g. insurance) who HSBC has introduced you to, those third parties may keep your information, and information relating to individuals connected to your business, in line with additional terms and conditions that apply to their product and services.
Transferring information overseas
Your information and information relating to individuals connected to your business may be transferred to and stored in locations outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including countries that may not have the same level of protection for personal information. When we do this, we'll ensure it has an appropriate level of protection and that the transfer is lawful. We may need to transfer information in this way to carry out our contract with you, to fulfil a legal obligation, to protect the public interest and/or for your or our legitimate interests. In some countries the law might compel us to share certain information (e.g. with tax authorities). Even in these cases, we'll only share information with people who have the right to see it.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your information (and information relating to individuals connected to your business) when it's transferred outside the EEA by contacting us using the details in the `More details about your information and information about individuals connected to your business' section on page 11.
Rights of individuals
Individuals have a number of rights in relation to the information that we hold about them. These rights include:
· the right to access information we hold about them and to obtain information about how we process it;
·in some circumstances, the right to withdraw their consent to our processing of their information, which they can do at any time. We may continue to process their information if we have another legitimate reason for doing so;

Again, there may be situations where individuals object to, or ask us to restrict, our processing of their information but we're entitled to continue processing their information and/or to refuse that request.
Individuals (including individuals connected to your business) can exercise their rights by contacting us using the details set out in the `More details about your information and information relating to individuals connected to your business' section on page 11.

Credit reference checks, fraud and money laundering
Credit reference checks If you apply for new products or services (including credit like a loan or credit card), we may perform credit and identity checks on you (and certain individuals connected to your business) with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs). When you use our banking services, we may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us.
To do this, we'll supply your information (and information of certain individuals connected to your business) to CRAs and they'll give us information about you and them. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history (and the financial situation and history of the relevant individuals connected your business). CRAs will supply us with both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit information, financial situation, history and fraud prevention information.
We may use this information to:
· assess if we can offer you credit and whether you can afford to take the product you applied for;
· verify the accuracy of the data you've provided to us;
· prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering;
· manage your account(s);
· trace and recover debts; and
· ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.
We'll continue to exchange information about you (and individuals connected to your business) with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We'll also inform the CRAs about your repayment history. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.
When CRAs receive a search request from us they'll place a search footprint on your credit file (or that of the relevant individual connected to your business) that may be seen by other lenders. If you apply for a bank account or credit (such as where you apply for a loan or credit card), we'll get details of your credit history from a CRA (and share information about you and individuals connected to your business with the CRA) and use this information to work out how much you can afford to borrow or pay back. We may also carry out further credit checks on you and individuals connected to your business while you're a customer to maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of your credit history. We may use this information to verify the accuracy of the information you've provided to us, to prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering, to manage your account(s), trace and recover debts and to ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances.
If you tell us that you have a financial associate (or, where you are an individual, a spouse), we'll link your records together. You should discuss this with them, and share this information with them before submitting the application. CRAs will also link your records (and those of individuals connected with your business) together and these links will remain on your and their files until you or the relevant individual successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.
The identities of the CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share information, data retention periods and data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail on their websites. They've created a joint document called the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) which is accessible from each of the three CRAs ­ clicking on any of these three links will also take you to the same CRAIN document:
Credit reference agencies: · CreditSafe ­ www.creditsafe.co.uk/crain
· Equifax ­ www.equifax.co.uk/crain
· Experian ­ www.experian.co.uk/crain
To comply with the law and for our own legitimate interest to enable us to assess and manage risk, we can share details about your financial situation and financial history, and the financial situation and history of individuals connected to your business with CRAs, fraud prevention agencies, etc. This includes information on any bank accounts or credit you have with us, including:
9

· how you manage your bank accounts or credit;
· if you owe us money;
· if we have concerns about financial crime;
·if you haven't kept up with your payments or paid off what you owe us (unless there's a genuine dispute over how much you owe us), or if you've agreed and stuck to a repayment plan.
Fraud prevention agencies We'll carry out checks with fraud prevention agencies for the purposes of preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity and the identity of individuals connected to your business before we provide products and services to you. These checks require us and these agencies to process information about you and individuals connected to your business.
The information you provide or which we've collected from you, or on your behalf, including from individuals connected to your business or received from third parties, will be used to carry out these checks in order to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity and the identity of individuals connected to your business. This includes information such as name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details, and device identifiers (e.g. IP address).
We and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to access and use information about you and individuals connected to your business to detect, investigate and prevent crime.
We process this information on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity and the identity of individuals connected to your business. This enables us to protect our business and to comply with laws that apply to us. This processing is also a contractual requirement of any of our products or services you use.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold information for different periods of time. If they're concerned about a possible fraud or money laundering risk this information and data can be held by them for up to six years.
Consequences of processing If we, or a fraud prevention agency, have reason to believe there's a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services and credit you've requested. We may also stop providing existing products and services to you and/or individuals connected to your business. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services to you and individuals connected to your business. The information we hold about you and information relating to individuals connected to your business, could make it easier or harder for you or them to get credit in the future.
To find out more about credit and fraud checks, read our `Guide to Credit Scoring, Credit Reference and Fraud Prevention Agencies' leaflet. You can get it from our website, in any of our branches or you can request a paper copy by contacting us in your preferred way. To find out more about fraud prevention agencies and how they manage your information, please visit www.cifas.org.uk/privacy-notice
What we need from you
You're responsible for making sure the information you give us, information which is provided by individuals connected to your business, or information which is otherwise provided on your behalf is accurate and up to date, and you must tell us if anything changes as soon as possible.
How we keep information secure
We use a range of measures to keep information safe and secure which may include encryption and other forms of security. We require our staff and any third parties who carry out any work on our behalf to comply with appropriate compliance standards including obligations to protect any information and applying appropriate measures for the use and transfer of information.

Appendix ­ How we process information about you and individuals connected to your business
We'll use your information and information about individuals connected to your business for purposes, including:

·To provide banking operations support: to enable the provision and function of our banking services in line with regulation, laws and customer rights and interests (e.g. complaints management and exit management). We do this to comply with our legal obligations, to perform our contract with you and because it's in our legitimate interest;
·To prevent and detect crime including (e.g. fraud, terrorist financing and money laundering): this will include monitoring, mitigation and risk management, carrying out customer due diligence, name screening, transaction screening and customer risk identification. We do this to comply with our legal obligations and because it's in our legitimate interest. We may share your information and information relating to individuals connected to your business with relevant agencies, law enforcement and other third parties where the law allows us to for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime. Additionally, we and other financial institutions may take steps to help prevent financial crime and manage risk. We'll do this because we have a legitimate interest, a legal obligation to prevent or detect crime or it's in the public interest. We may be required to use your information and information relating to individuals connected to your business to do this, even if you or they have asked us to stop using your/their information. That could include (among other things):
­screening, intercepting and investigating any payments, instructions or communications you send or receive (including drawdown requests and application forms);
­investigating who you're paying or who's paying you (e.g. checks on payments into and out of your account and other parties related to those payments);

­checking whether the people or organisations you're paying or receiving payments from are who they say they are, and aren't subject to any sanctions.
·To undertake risk management: to measure, detect and prevent the likelihood of financial, reputational, legal, compliance or customer risk. This includes credit risk, traded risk, operational risk and insurance risk (e.g. for underwriting or claims management purposes).
