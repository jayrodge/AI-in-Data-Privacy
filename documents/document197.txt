When you enter a page on our website that contains a Facebook plugin your browser or app will establish a direct connection to Facebook's servers where the plugin is loaded from.

This information (including your IP address) will be sent by your browser directly to a server of Facebook in the USA and stored there.
If you are logged into your Facebook account at the same time, it is also possible to assign the page impression to your Facebook profile. If you click on embedded Facebook buttons and log into your Facebook account (or are already logged in), this information will be sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The corresponding information is published on your Facebook profile and in your chronicle/timeline in short form. Facebook can thus collect and store additional usage data. If you want to prevent the transmission and storage of your data and your behaviour on our online services through Facebook, you must log out of your Facebook account before you visit our sites and delete any cookies placed by Facebook. You can also prevent the loading of the Facebook plugins with add-ons for your browser, e.g. with the online "Facebook Blocker".

2.2.4 Newsletter
With the following information, we will inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch, statistical evaluation procedure and your right of objection. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt of the newsletter and the procedures described. We do this in the pursuit of our legitimate interest of marketing our business.
We send out newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications with promotional information (hereinafter "Newsletter") subject to the consent of the recipient or a legal permission.
The registration for our newsletter is handled through a so-called double opt-in procedure, which means you will receive an e-mail after your registration, in which you will be asked to confirm your registration once again. The registrations for the newsletter are recorded in order to prove the accurate registration process according to legal requirements. This includes storing the time of logon and confirmation. Furthermore changes to the data stored by Mailchimp are being recorded.
The newsletter will be sent by means of "MailChimp", a newsletter platform of the US company Rocket Science Group // 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA or "Cheetah Digital", a newsletter platform of the US company Experian Information Solutions, Inc // 475 Anton Boulevard, Costa Mesa, CA 92626 United States.The e-mail addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as further data described in the context of this information, are being stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send out and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. In addition, MailChimp can use this data to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the dispatch and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes in order to determine from which countries the recipients come from. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to contact them independently or transfer data to third parties.
MailChimp is certified under the US-EU-Data-Privacy-Agreement the "Privacy Shield" and is committed to comply with EU data protection requirements. Furthermore, we have concluded the "EU Model Clauses" with MailChimp. This is a data protection agreement which obliges MailChimp to protect the data of our users, to process according to its privacy regulations on our behalf and in particular not to pass data on to third parties. You can view the privacy policy of MailChimp here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.
In order to register for the newsletter, we only need your e-mail address. Further voluntarily provided information about you is only used to personalize the newsletter.
There are cases where we direct the newsletter recipients to the MailChimp websites. E.g. our newsletters contain a link with which the newsletter recipients can access the newsletters online (for example in the case of display problems in the e-mail program). Furthermore, newsletter recipients can subsequently change their data (like their e-mail address). Likewise, the data privacy policy of MailChimp is only available on their website.
You may terminate the receipt of our newsletter at any time, which means revoke your consent. Therewith your consent to the dispatch of the newsletter via MailChimp as well as the statistical analyses expire at the same time. A separate cancellation of the dispatch via MailChimp or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible. You will find a link to unsubscribe from our newsletter at the bottom of each newsletter.

2.3 When using our technologies and services via websites and online services of our clients
2.3.1 Our Tracking | Use of Cookies
We use cookies to provide our tracking services, which also include our reporting services. Please find some general information on cookies here.
Tracking allows us to understand which website referred a user to another website, so that the second website can acquire more website traffic. We measure the success of these referrals and assist the payment of commissions from the website receiving the traffic to the website referring that traffic.
We store cookies on devices of users who are visiting websites and using online services of our clients in order to record business transactions (leads and sales such as signing up for a newsletter or placing an order in a web shop). The only purposes of our tracking cookies are to allocate one successful advertisement to a particular business transaction, and to perform corresponding billing services. Personally identifiable information on the user are neither collected nor processed nor used in tracking. Nothing but the information when and on which device a click on an advertisement occurred is stored in tracking cookies. We only store an individual sequence of figures that cannot reveal the name of a particular user and contains information on
- the Merchant's Partner Programme - the Affiliate - the specific time of the user's action (click or view)
While tracking we may also collect information on the device that is used to perform a business transaction such as the device's operating system and browser.
We collect this data ourselves and share this data with Merchants, Affiliates and Agencies which use our network from time to time. We also receive this data from those entities.
Our tracking cookies are listed below.
