Types of processed data
Navigation data
IT systems and software procedures adopted for the functioning of this website, as a part of their normal functioning, collect various items of personal data. The said personal data is transferred as a part of the normal course of events when using the Internet (based on TCP/IP protocol).

Cookie Policy The Reply website (hereinafter referred to as the "Website") uses Cookies to make its services simple and effective for users visiting the portal page.

Cookies are text files, or parcels of information sent from a web server (the website www.reply.com) to the user's browser, which are memorised on the computer and automatically returned to the server every time the website is accessed.
There are various types of Cookie, some used to make using the Website more efficient, others to enable certain functions. For example, Cookies can:
· memorise entered preferences; · prevent users from having to re-enter the same information several times during their visit,
for example username and password; · analyse use of the services and contents provided by the website visited in order to optimise
the browsing experience and services offered.
Types of Cookies used by the Reply website
The types of Cookies used by the Reply website are listed below, grouped according to their reasons for use.
Technical Cookies
This type of Cookie allows certain sections of the Website to function correctly and are essential in order to allow the user to browse the Website and use its features. There are two categories of technical cookies:
· persistent: once the browser has been closed these are not cancelled, but last until a predefined expiry date;
· session: these are automatically cancelled each time the browser is closed.
These Cookies, always sent by the "reply.com" domain, are necessary for the correct visualisation of the Website and, in relation to the technical services offered, will therefore always be used and sent (unless the user modifies the settings in his or her browser). Included in this category are the persistent Cookies used to allow the user to register with the Website and access its restricted area.
The aforementioned Cookies used by the Website avoid the need to use other data processing techniques which could potentially reduce the confidentiality of the users' navigation of the website, and do not permit the acquisition of identifying personal information regarding the user.
Functionality Cookies
The Cookies in this category are used to memorise certain settings selected by the user, in order to remember their preferences during future visits.
These Cookies can have the duration of a session but they are generally persistent and sent from the "reply.com" domain. They may also be used when providing a service not explicitly requested by, but provided to the user.
The information gathered by these cookies is anonymous and cannot track the user's behaviour on other websites.
Included in this category, for example, are Cookies used primarily to memorise the user's preferences regarding the country of origin and therefore the language in which the text of the Website is viewed.

Performance Cookies
The cookies in this category (which also include so-called "Cookie analytics") are used to gather information regarding use of the website.
The Reply website uses this information to obtain anonymous statistical analyses in order to improve use of its Website and to adapt its contents to the desires of its visitors. This type of Cookie gathers information anonymously regarding the user's activity and how he or she arrived at the Website.
Analytical cookies may be sent from the Website itself (so-called "first-party" Cookies) but they are generally sent from third party domains / websites (so-called "third-party" Cookies).
Included in this category, for example, are Web Analytics, where the data gathered is limited to use of the website by the user and the number of accesses to the website, in order to manage the performance and structure of the website. These cookies are generally persistent.
Cookies to integrate products and software functions from third parties
This type of Cookie integrates functions developed by third parties into the pages of the Website such as icons and preferences expressed on social networks (for example, Facebook, Twitter) in order to share the contents of the Website or for the use of third party software services (such as software to generate maps and other software offering additional services). These Cookies are sent by third party domains and partner websites, which therefore offer their features within the pages of the Website.
Third party cookies for marketing / retargeting
The Cookies in this category are only third-party and are used to create user profiles in order to send advertising messages or present advertising banners for the Website when the user is browsing on other websites, in line with the preferences demonstrated by the user within the pages of the Website.
The Reply website does not use first-party profiling cookies.
The user's consent
According to regulations, the Reply website is not obliged to request consent for first-party technical and analytical Cookies, as they are necessary in order to provide the services requested. They are therefore installed automatically by the Website during the user's first visit to any page of the portal.
For other types of Cookie, consent is requested via a pop-up banner: this implies active behaviour on the part of the user, meaning that the latter can give his or her consent by clicking on the "OK" button.
For all other types of Cookies the user can give his or her consent by one or more of the following means:
· via specific browser settings used to browse the pages that form the Website (see the following section);
· via modifications to the settings for the use of third party services. Please note that certain areas or features of the Website rely on the use of Cookies, meaning that disabling Cookies using one of the solutions indicated above could prevent the user from visualising

certain parts of the Website correctly or using specific features offered by the Website (for example authentication and access to the restricted area of the website).
How to manage the Cookies used by the Reply website through browser configuration
Nearly all internet browsers are set up to automatically accept Cookies. The user can modify the predefined configuration (generally set to "medium" level) and disable Cookies, selecting from the form provided (generally entitled "Privacy") the highest level of protection.
