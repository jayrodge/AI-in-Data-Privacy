Policy Statement
The University will collect, use, store and disclose personal information as necessary to carry out its purposes (core functions and activities), including its statutory functions, in alignment with the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website) and this document.

1. Privacy Principles
The Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website) requires that public sector organisations such as the University comply with the IPPs as set out in Part 2 of the Act. The University has established processes and procedures which align with the summarised privacy principles below.

1.1. Purpose of Collection
IPP1 is a collection principle. An agency should not collect personal information unless it is for the lawful purpose connected with a function or activity of that agency, and it is necessary to collect that information for that purpose.

1.2. Source of Personal Information
IPP2 outlines that personal information must be collected directly from the individual concerned unless the collection is believed to be an exception on reasonable grounds, such as the information is already publicly available.

1.3. Collection of Information
IPP3 outlines that during collection of personal information, an agency must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual is aware of the fact the information is being collected, for what purpose, and who will use it.

1.4. Manner of Collection
IPP4 outlines that the personal information must not be collected by unlawful means or means that are unfair or intrude on the personal affairs of the individual.

1.5. Storage and Security
IPP5 outlines the standards that organisations must meet for the accuracy, currency, completeness and security of personal information.
1.6. Access

UCPL-4-191 IPP6 outlines access rights to personal information held by an agency.
1.7. Correction of Information IPP7 outlines access and correction rights, giving a general right of access to personal information and the right to have that information corrected if it is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.
1.8. Checking Accuracy of Information Before Use IPP8 specifies that an agency must take all reasonable steps to ensure information is accurate, complete, relevant and not misleading prior to using that information.
1.9. Retention of Information IPP9 specifies that an agency cannot keep information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may be lawfully used.
1.10. Limits on Use IPP10 specifies that an agency cannot use information that has been collected for one purpose, for another purpose that was not originally specified.
1.11. Limits on Disclosure IPP11 outlines the limits under which an agency may disclose collected personal information. For example, personal information must not be disclosed unless the agency reasonably believes that the disclosure is authorised by the individual and is in connection with the purpose for which it was obtained.
1.12. Unique Identifiers IPP12 says that a unique identifier must not be assigned to individuals, unless it is necessary to enable the agency to perform its functions efficiently. This provides a safeguard against the creation of a single identifier that could be used to crossmatch data across agencies.

 The University is authorised or required by law or regulatory requirements to disclose the information to, for example but not limited to, the IRD or StudyLink; and/or
 The information is provided to a third party that provides services to the University in alignment with its core function, in which case the University will ensure that the service provider agrees to preserve the confidentiality of personal information; and/or

The University does not sell, rent or trade personal information. Where organisations or businesses seek to inform individuals about employment, other opportunities or membership of professional organisations, it is acceptable for the University to receive the material and send it out on the organisation's behalf, recouping any associated costs from the organisation or business. Otherwise, if no consent to receive marketing material has been obtained from individuals, a request to market to individuals directly would be declined.
Individuals who receive this information will then have the ability to `opt in' to an opportunity if they wish to be contacted or involved further with the external organisation/business. The University will not disclose personal information externally.

The IPPs apply to both physical (hard-copy) and electronic files or collections of personal information, including data. A significant portion of the personal information collected by the University is held on electronic databases; other information is stored in unstructured digital formats such as email, electronic documents or images/film.

In some instances digital records (such as email, records stored in non-University, cloud-based repositories, or on removable storage media such as USB drives, hard drives or CDs) pose a significant risk of unauthorised access, loss or alteration. No sensitive personal information should be stored in uncontrolled systems or locations.

Personal information stored digitally has access restricted to only those staff needing to access it, and is deleted from the system when no longer required for the purposes identified in section 2.1 `Purpose of Collection'. This disposal is determined by reference to the General Disposal Authority for New Zealand Universities DA337 (University of Canterbury website).

Deletion of information should be approved in line with the University records disposal framework. If in doubt, consult with the University Privacy Officer or the University Information and Records Manager.

Personal information stored in hard-copy formats is kept in a secure location (i.e., locked), accessed only by staff who are authorised for the purposes outlined during collection and, if it is accessed or retrieved from storage, a note recording its access and return is logged. Other steps taken to keep hard-copy personal information secure include
 keeping non-current material in locked filing cabinets/cupboards,
 ensuring personal information is not exposed to unauthorised people,
 locking offices while not in use, and/or
 ensuring personal information is not left on desks or open work spaces overnight.

Personal information is destroyed with safeguards taken to prevent inadvertent disclosure of the information:
 By shredding or placement in a locked bin which has the contents disposed of in a confidential and secure manner; and
 With expert assistance if disposing of computer hardware.

4.6. Work Taken out of a Unit
It is recognised that there are critical times when staff may need to remove personal information from a business unit or college (e.g. job applications or marking). It is preferable that this information is only accessed offsite via electronic means through University networks. If that is impossible and it is absolutely necessary that personal information is to leave a business unit or college, staff must take the following precautions:
 Personal information travels securely ­ it is in a locked briefcase, or on an encrypted, password protected media file or device.
 Multiple instances of electronic personal information must not be copied to removable storage media or removed from secure systems. Examples of this type of personal information include
o databases of student information;
o databases of staff information; and
o spread sheets of personal information such as alumni lists.
 If travelling by public or private transport, information must not be left unattended at any time.
 During the time it is away from the University, all reasonable steps are taken to ensure the information is not accessed by unauthorised people.

4.7. Misuse of Personal Information

Without limiting the definition of misuse of personal information, the following practices are unacceptable to the University*:
 intentionally breaching the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website), the Official Information Act 1982 (New Zealand Legislation website) or the access restrictions imposed by the Public Records Act 2005 (New Zealand Legislation website);
 reading or copying personal information to which the reader/copier has no authorised access;
 divulging personal information given under an express undertaking it will remain confidential or, intentionally divulging personal information to any person who is not an authorised recipient of that information without lawful excuse;
 intentionally introducing false or misleading material into any University database or file/record, or falsifying such records or deleting such records without authorisation; and
 using personal information for any purpose other than the purposes identified in section 2 `Purpose, Collection, Consent, Use and Disclosure' unless the individual has given explicit, informed consent to do so.

*Note: Section 105A Crimes Act 1961 (New Zealand Legislation website), `Corrupt use of official information'. It is an offence if an official corruptly uses or discloses

UCPL-4-191 any information, acquired by him or her in his or her official capacity, to obtain, directly or indirectly, an advantage or a pecuniary gain for the official or any other person.
4.8. Personnel Files
Personal information gathered from and/or about a successful applicant for employment or appointment at the University, will be retained on their personnel file for the purpose of considering and evaluating any other application they may make for employment or appointment by the University in any role other than that for which they originally applied to the University.
4.8.1. Unsuccessful Job Applications
Information relating to unsuccessful applications are destroyed1 following the closing-off of the file for appointment, unless applicants request that their applications be retained for future consideration for other similar vacancies, should they arise. In such instances, notice will be provided to give the applicant an opportunity to update the information provided.
4.8.2. Evaluative Material Related to Job Application
Evaluative material is maintained centrally with any regular personnel file/record but it is sectioned off (either physically within the same file or into separate files, or electronically using access rights and metadata) from the non-evaluative material (appointment letters, employment agreements, salary histories, leave records etc.).
This information is available to those staff members normally party to that evaluation process, or who require it for a further authorised and specified purpose. It is not automatically available to the individual concerned (see the grounds for refusal in Part 4 of the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website)) and should be removed prior to an individual reviewing their personal file/record.
4.8.3. Retention of Personnel Records
All personnel records are retained only for as long as needed, and then disposed as either archives or destroyed based on their values as determined by section 7 of the General Disposal Authority for New Zealand Universities DA337 (University of Canterbury website).

1 Destruction is governed by the General Disposal Authority for New Zealand Universities DA337 (University of Canterbury website), Class 7.1.1 and with reference to the University's Records Disposal Framework (UC Information and Records Management website).

4.9. Collection and Distribution of Students' Assessed Material
Academic departments ensure that the collection and distribution of student work is secure. If assignments are collected or distributed using an online learning system (e.g. Learn), only authorised staff may access course details and receipt submitted material, or access and distribute grade information. The mark or grade that a student receives for a piece of work, is only disclosed to authorised staff,2 e.g. those staff members normally party to that assessment process or staff who require access in order to perform their work. If assignments are collected by using locked postal boxes in a public area, departments check the boxes are cleared regularly to avoid overflow. Class lists are not downloaded and published outside of any online learning system (such as Learn), in any format/venue:
 Where work and grades are distributed in person, cover sheets with only the student's name and/or identification number are visible.
 Assessments must not be left outside offices or in hallways without being monitored/secure.
 If grading or assessment information is communicated orally, it is done in an area where others cannot overhear it.
5. Sensitive Personal Information
5.1. Management of Sensitive Information
The University recognises that some personal information can be more sensitive than other personal information (refer to definitions). To determine sensitivity, the question is whether an individual will suffer any actual loss or humiliation, loss of dignity and/or injury to feelings, if the information is lost or inappropriately accessed or used. For example the inappropriate disclosure of an individual's mental health status would be considered a breach of sensitive personal information.
Sensitive personal information recorded physically should not be left in staff pigeonholes or in-trays. It must be in a secure or locked area.
Hard-copy internal mail which contains sensitive personal information is sent in a sealed envelope and labelled as "strictly private and confidential" and "to be opened by the addressee only", rather than using the reusable internal mail envelopes.
Special consideration applications or related records (including applications for special conditions for examinations and tests) are considered sensitive personal information. It may be appropriate to store any medical or psychological evidence with the UC Health Centre.
Sensitive personal information is normally kept separate from any general file/record about an individual, either physically or in a digital environment, using access controls and metadata tags. This information is only accessible to the

parties directly involved (although some material may be withheld from the individual concerned ­ see the grounds of refusal including evaluative material in the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website) and section 2.5 "Use and Disclosure").
When supplying information via telephone, email or text messages, the receiver of the information should be verified as per section 4.5 `Record Keeping'.

6. Email

6.1. Email Management and Handling of Personal Information to Prevent Breaches
With regard to email, members of the University should refer to the IT Policy Framework (PDF, 138KB) and the following:
 Email is not guaranteed to be a secure or private form of communication. Unauthorised people may read emails by a variety of methods, for example, through reading the contents of an unattended screen, through maintenance of the Exchange server or desktop, through incorrect addressing, forwarding, or through hacking.
 Emails sent or received by a University staff member might be subject to requests for access under the Official Information Act 1982 (New Zealand Legislation website) and the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website).
 Personal information is not sent by email, unless by careful consideration it is deemed reasonable to send the personal information by email.
 Sensitive personal information (refer to section 5) is not sent by email, unless in all the circumstances, it is reasonable to send sensitive personal information by email. If an email containing sensitive personal information is sent, a `test email' should be sent first and the intended recipient should be identified either by phone or by an appropriate identifier in a return email. The message or an attachment to the email may also be encrypted using a password which has been given to the intended recipient by phone or other secure and independent means.
 When sending emails, care must be taken not to send (or `Cc' or `Bcc') to other individuals who do not require the information.
 Where possible, attachments sent with an email message are opened on the email message prior to sending, to review and confirm whether the correct file has been attached.
 University staff members should check email folders regularly (but at least annually) to ensure there is no personal information which should be deleted, or captured/migrated for inclusion on an electronic file or in an electronic system, or printed for inclusion on a physical file. Personal information should only be retained if it is needed for the purposes of University business, including audit and retention requirements.

UCPL-4-191  No one should forward any personal information contained in an email to a third party, without the author's permission.
6.2. Legal Disclaimer on Emails
The use of email disclaimers is required as a protection against legal threats in instances such as breach of confidentiality (accidental or otherwise), transmission of viruses, negligent misstatement, and employer liability.
This policy mandates the use of a standard email disclaimer. This disclaimer is applied to all outgoing emails from the University.
6.2.1. Email Disclaimer Appended to all Outgoing Emails from the University
The following information must be attached at the end of each outgoing email from all University email accounts:
`This email may be confidential and subject to legal privilege, it may not reflect the views of the University of Canterbury, and it is not guaranteed to be virus free. If you are not an intended recipient, please notify the sender immediately and erase all copies of the message and any attachments.
IT Services shall append this disclaimer to all University staff emails leaving the campus network.
The full text of the disclaimer available at the above URL is also in Appendix B of this document. For further information on best practice for email etiquette refer to Email Management at UC (University of Canterbury website).

7. Responsibility for Compliance

UCPL-4-191
University Privacy Officer (or approved delegate) maintains a regularly updated webpage and uses other formats as required.

7.2. Information Management Network
Each portfolio and college delegates first-line responsibility for privacy issues to a Privacy Nominee. Collectively, this group of nominees is known as the Information Management Network, which covers further information management support beyond privacy and is supported by the University Privacy Officer (information in section 8 `The Role of the University Privacy Officer') with training, awareness raising and investigations by staff from the Information and Records Management Office. Membership of the Information Management Network is voluntary and is in addition to the normal duties and requirements of each member.
The Information Management Network will:
 Provide first line support for staff and students from each college or SMT member's portfolio on privacy issues or concerns, in particular, by providing advice and guidance and in answering basic queries;
 Where necessary, escalate matters of concern to the University Privacy Officer or the University Information and Records Manager as appropriate;
 Provide support to respective Senior Management Team members on privacy issues affecting their portfolios/colleges, and act as a resource for use in projects that will affect privacy matters;
 Meet on a regular basis to share experience, gain knowledge and take advice from the University Privacy Officer.

8. The Role of the University Privacy Officer
The University Privacy Officer is a role mandated by the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website). At the University, the Registrar is the University Privacy Officer. The University Privacy Officer encourages compliance with the IPPs within the University, deals with requests under the Privacy Act 1993 (New Zealand Legislation website) and in the case of any complaints or investigations, works alongside the Privacy Commissioner.
While the Privacy Nominee (refer to section 7.2: `Information Management Network') is available to answer any privacy-related queries, any matter not covered by this document should be referred to the University Privacy Officer.
