Information You Post

Any comments or personal information that you post on public pages (such as social media sites), within the Sites or otherwise, is publicly available and may be viewed, collected, and used by others, including Viasat. Viasat is not responsible for the accuracy of any information contained in those postings.

Cookies and Other Tracking

We and our service providers may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Services and may combine this information with other Information we or our service providers collect from you.

Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We and our third party service providers may use "cookies" on our Sites to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Sites, as well as to conduct analytics on and collect usage data related to our Sites.

For example, we may use cookies to remember your username and password, if you choose to store them. We may also use cookies to determine when your current session on the Sites should be logged out after a period of no activity, as well as for efficient management of the servers providing our Sites.

There are two types of cookies we use on the Sites: session-based cookies and persistent cookies. In addition, we may also allow vendors to use "third party" cookies for specific purposes on our Sites. A description of each of these cookies is provided below.

Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. When you authorize us to do so, we may use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Sites. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites.
Persistent Cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. When you authorize us to do so, we may use persistent cookies to allow our systems to remember you and automatically log you in to our Sites.

Third Party Cookies/Applications. We may also engage third party services such as Google Analytics to provide us with information that helps us improve our Services and the experiences of our customers. These third party services may use session or persistent cookies or other applications to uniquely identify you via your user credentials while you are logged in to our Sites. These third party cookies and other applications do not collect any personally identifiable information other than the user credentials you provide.
Clear Graphics Interchange Formats ("GIFs"). Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. In addition, we or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.



How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

While most browsers will allow you to block cookies by enabling a Do Not Track header within the browser, our system does not recognize Do Not Track headers. However, we only use cookies as described in this Policy.
