5. Response to "Do Not Track" Signals. Some web browsers may transmit "do-nottrack" signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Vets First Choice currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.

We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods.

(i) Requiring both a personal username and a password in order for you to access your Personal Information;
